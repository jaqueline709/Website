## Dogs

So during one of our classes, we briefly touched upon the different properties/data that a dog can have, such as name, breed, size, etc. I'm not only able to make a string that includes this data but I can also use Python to perform methods to, such 

{python}
fruit_prices = {
'apple': 0.65,
'mango': 1.50,
'strawberry': '$3/lb',
'musk melon': 'unavailable'
}
fruit_prices['mango']
