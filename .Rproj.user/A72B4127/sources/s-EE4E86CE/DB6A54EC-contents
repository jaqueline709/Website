## Edgar Allen Poe Lines

So during one of our classes, we went over mutliple regular expressions (regex), where you can select rows where a variable matches a pattern or capture groups as well as substituting and splitting groups.

I'm not only able to make a string that includes data (such as an Edgar Allen Poe line) but I can also use Python to perform methods such as making all of the words lowercase, removing the punctuation, splitting the string at every whitespace, and matching a phrase to the original string. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
import re
string = "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—"
print(string)
string1_lower=string.lower()
print(string1)
string2_nopunct = re.sub(r'[\.\,\—]', "", string1)
print(string2_nopunct)

string3_split = re.split(r'[\s]', string2_nopunct)
print(string3_split)
re.findall(r'[wW]hile[^—]+', string)
```
```{python}
